If a username and a password is not given when we clone a repository 
from the remote server, after modifying a file, we can commit to the
local repository but cannot push the updated content to the remote server.

The ".git" folder really exists, but I think that it is hidden.
So I cannot see it in Linux using "ls" or "ll" commands, or using the 
File Browser.
